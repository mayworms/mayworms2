I am a first year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan School of Information</a> (UMSI), advised by <a href="https://oliverhaimson.com/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Oliver L. Haimson</a> and <a href="https://michaelannethomas.com" target="_blank">Dr. Michaelanne Thomas</a>.

Some of my current research interests include trans-centered online communities, content moderation, platform governance, folk theorization, and alternative online infrastructures.

I graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Relations and Policy in 2017, and from UMSI with a Master of Science in Information in May 2022. Prior to graduate school, I worked in public and academic libraries.
